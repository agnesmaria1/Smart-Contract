# Smart-Contract

To automate the creation of joint savings accounts, we are creating a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses. These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account. Our smart contract will use ether management functions to implement a financial institutionâ€™s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features will consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.
